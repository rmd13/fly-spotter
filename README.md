# fly spotter 

This repository contains code that was used for extraction of fly locations in "MED13 and glycolysis are conserved modifiers of Î±-synuclein-associated neurodegeneration" 


## Installation 

Download and add the following to your MATLAB path:


```
https://github.com/sg-s/movie-analyser
https://github.com/sg-s/fly-spotter/

```


## Usage 


Go to the folder containing `flySpotter` and run the demo using:

A new GUI will pop up allowing you to manually inspect the locations of every fly. If a fly is missed, use the "+fly" button to add it. If something is incorrectly labelled as a fly, use the "-fly" button. Finally, use the "Save Data" button to export X,Y and areas of detected flies into a CSV file.
